 <br> <font face="Aerial" size="4"> 	&#8594;	&rarr; Like Blinking of LED.</font>
 <br> <font face=Aerial size="4"    	&#8594;	&rarr; Proximity sensor to sense and glow a LED using proximity sensor.</font>
 <br> <font size="4"> I really enjoyed learning this new topic.</font>
 <br><font face="Aerial" size=4"> I was thinking of using proximity sensor in sensing the level of any fluid and making us aware of any danger happening.
       Along with controlling the speed of any object.</font>

  <br>		&#8594;	&rarr; Today I learnt about the Hr-Sr04 senosr and used it to sense an object and glow a LED light after sensing.
  <br> 	&#8594;	&rarr; Today I also learnt about 3D designning and design the basic structure in 3D like cube,sphere,cyclinder.
