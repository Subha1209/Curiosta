<p> Hello! </p>
 <font face="Aerial" color="Blue" size=12">Today I learned about the basic Programming In Arduino..</font>
  <br> -> Like Blinking of LED.
  <br> -> Proximity sensor to sense and glow the LED.. 
  <br> I really enjoyed learning this new topic.
  <br><font face="Aerial" color="Red" size=12"> I was thinking of using proximity sensor in sensing the level of any fluid and making us aware of any danger happening.
   Along with controlling the speed of any object.</font>
